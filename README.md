## Overview
This project is a decentralised peer-to-peer lending platform built on the Stellar blockchain. It empowers unbanked and credit-invisible individuals to access small loans without a credit history. Borrowers can increase loan amounts and reduce interest rates as they successfully repay, while lenders can review profiles and assess the risk/reward of each loan. The platform leverages Stellar's blockchain for fast, low-cost transactions and integrates advanced authentication methods for secure interactions. 
## Key Features
### Accessible Borrowing
Users can borrow small amounts without needing a credit history, unlocking access to larger loans with lower interest rates upon repayment.
### Profitable Lending
Lenders can assess borrower profiles and make informed decisions based on repayment history and risk.
### Stellar Blockchain 
Fast, low-cost, and secure transactions for both borrowers and lenders.
### Passkey Authentication
Secure login and transaction signing using Face ID or fingerprint through Stellar's ecosystem.
## Technologies Used
- Rust with Soroban SDK: Smart contract development on Stellar.
- Stellar CLI: For contract compilation, deployment, and NPM package generation.
- NPM CLI: To publish and reuse contract packages across projects.
- Express Server: Securely submits transactions and handles smart contract interactions with passkeys.
- React and Vite: Front-end technologies used alongside the Stellar JavaScript SDK for account and transaction management.
- Passkeys and Freighter Wallet: Ensures secure user authentication and transaction signing.
